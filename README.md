## TASK ACCOMPLISHED

Development of an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price data for the traders.

This will alert them of potential trading opportunities.The visualization of charts and data analysis the trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective.

I learnt how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.
